										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have this new Casio DP-1 drum pad set. It was packed in a cardboard box. Brackets for attaching it to a drum stand are still sealed in their plastic bags. The  instruction sheet is included. As you can see in the pictures, I removed one drum set from its bag for the pictures. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-casio-Drum-.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1402" title="A casio Drum" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-casio-Drum--300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-casio-Drum--300x198.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-casio-Drum-.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />

I don&#8217;t believe anything was ever opened before. Bar code number 79767 39016 along with &#8220;made in Japan&#8221; was the only other information on the box.</p>
<p>I could find no date.</p>
<p>Instructions state it is for connecting to a Casiotone Keyboard. My old Casio keyboard did not have the right jacks to plug the Drum Pads in. If it had I probably would have given this to my Grandsons, as it is it needs a good home<br />
I am asking $29.00 plus postage for it. I am open to offers. I accept PayPal. I can be reached at <strong>rodander@frontiernet.net </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a JVC digital video camera model no. GR-D30V. It says 700X digital zoom, 16X optical zoom, 520 resolution. I have the battery and the charger but no tape. The controls all seem to work. As you can see on the pictures below <strong>the screen is all garbled lines</strong>.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-video-Camera.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1286" title="A video Camera" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-video-Camera-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-video-Camera-300x190.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A-video-Camera.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-video-camera-.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1287" title="B video camera" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-video-camera--300x255.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="255" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-video-camera--300x255.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/01/B-video-camera-.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />

The camera is clean and looks good. I had planned to repair it myself, so I have been saving it for a couple of years. I have decided this is beyond my ability and ambition. I do not have the owners manual but that is available on line.<br />
I am asking $50.00 plus postage for it. I am open to offers. I do accept PayPal. I can be reached at <strong>rodander@frontiernet.net </strong></p>

<p>I have two Vonage D-Link broadband telephone adapters. The first is brand new sealed in its plastic box with all accessory&#8217;s.  It is labeled internet phone service and starter kit The original price tag is on it yet, stating $49.99.</p>
<p>The second was used and has no package and no instruction book. I will include the phone cable. They are both Model VTA-VR .<br />
My son used the system for a time in his business and had the new one as a spare.</p>
<p>I contemplated adopting this phone system. I figured it wasn&#8217;t worth the effort for this old man to learn something new.</p>
<p>They have been on my shelf for over a year. I really know very little about them, so it is now time for me to sell them.<br />
I will sell both for $35.00 plus postage. I would be open to offers as I need to move them along. I do accept PayPal. Contact me at <strong>rodander@frontiernet.net</strong><br />
